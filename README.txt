GREAT TODOs: 
            - add labels to assemblty preproccesor -- to hard
                -that also means decoding signed stuff, idk
                - also in trace with imm shift instructions 400 is added to imm because of the instr(30) determening bit
                
            -TO add an instruction, you need to add it to the soc, the IO_pack both for input and output
                - new mnemonic in the mnemonic_pack
                - new opcode defs in the def_pac...
